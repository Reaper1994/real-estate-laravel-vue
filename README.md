# Real Estate Property Listing and Offer System

## Overview

This project is a demo web application built with Laravel and Vue, I've been itching to try this more modern approach since it's all the rage these days, and I have to say, it's a whole new ballgame compared to the classic Blade or even Livewire methods. My project has the basics covered â€” user registration, authentication, and authorization with email verification. But wait, there's more! I've also thrown in real-time listing filtering and pagination, image uploading, full-screen image previews, offers and notifications, a real-time interest calculator, and a bunch of other cool features.
